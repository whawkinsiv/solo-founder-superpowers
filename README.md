# Solo Founder Superpowers

A comprehensive knowledge base for non-technical founders building SaaS applications with AI tools (Claude Code, Lovable, Replit, Cursor).

Covers the full software development lifecycle plus business, product, and marketing skills — all written as actionable guides, checklists, and reference material.

## What's Inside

### Developer Skills (`developer-skills/`)

Eight phases covering the complete build lifecycle:

| Phase | Skill | What It Covers |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | **Scope** | Turn ideas into AI-ready specs |
| 2 | **Design** | UX/UI patterns, Laws of UX, component libraries |
| 3 | **Build** | AI-assisted dev workflows, tool selection |
| 4 | **Secure** | Security checklists, OWASP Top 10 |
| 5 | **Optimize** | Speed, code, database, dependency tuning |
| 6 | **Test** | Scenarios, edge cases, intentional bug hunting |
| 7 | **Debug** | Systematic debugging, error interpretation |
| 8 | **Monitor** | Production health, incident response |

Each phase has a `SKILL.md` entry point plus supporting reference files.

### Non-Code Skills (`non-code-skills/`)

## How to Use

These skills are designed for use with AI coding tools. The recommended workflow:

```
1. Scope    — Write a feature spec (10-15 min)
2. Design   — Reference UX patterns (as needed)
3. Build    — Give spec to AI, iterate (1-3 hours)
4. Secure   — Run security checklist (15 min)
5. Optimize — Quick performance check (5 min)
6. Test     — Happy path + edge cases (15 min)
7. Debug    — Fix issues found (varies)
8. Monitor  — Set up monitoring (first deploy)
```

For MVPs, focus on Scope, Build, and Test. Add the rest as you approach production.
