# Solo Founder Skills

60 expert skills for non-technical founders building SaaS with AI tools (Claude Code, Lovable, Replit, Cursor).

Covers the full lifecycle of planning, building, launching, and growing a software business — actionable guides, checklists, and copy-paste prompts.

## Installation

**Note:** Installation differs by platform. Claude Code or Cursor have built-in plugin marketplaces. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.

### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Claude Code, register the marketplace first:

```
/plugin marketplace add whawkinsiv/solo-founder-skills
```

Then install the plugin from this marketplace:

```
/plugin install solo-founder-skills@solo-founder-skills-marketplace
```

#### Upgrading from Solo Founder Superpowers

This plugin was renamed. The old plugin and marketplace names no longer exist, so
an existing install stops loading after an update. Remove the old install first:

```
/plugin uninstall solo-founder-superpowers@solo-founder-superpowers-marketplace
/plugin marketplace remove solo-founder-superpowers-marketplace
```

Then add the new marketplace and install the plugin with the commands above.

Manual skill invocations also changed. Replace `/solo-founder-superpowers:plan`
with `/solo-founder-skills:plan`.

### Cursor (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:

```
/plugin-add solo-founder-skills
```

### Codex (Manual Setup)

Codex discovers skills from `.agents/skills/` directories. Clone this repo into your project:

```
git clone https://github.com/whawkinsiv/solo-founder-skills.git .agents/skills/solo-founder-skills
```

Or install a single skill using the built-in skill installer:

```
$skill-installer install https://github.com/whawkinsiv/solo-founder-skills/tree/main/skills/build
```

Restart Codex after installing. Invoke skills with `$skill-name` or let Codex select them automatically.

### OpenCode (Manual Setup)

OpenCode discovers skills from `.opencode/skills/`, `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, or `~/.agents/skills/`. Clone into any of these locations:

```
git clone https://github.com/whawkinsiv/solo-founder-skills.git .opencode/skills/solo-founder-skills
```

Skills are loaded on-demand — OpenCode will show available skills and load them when relevant.

### Verify Installation

Start a new session in your chosen platform and ask for something that should trigger a skill (for example, "help me validate this idea" or "help me plan this feature"). The agent should automatically invoke the relevant solo-founder-skills skill.

## Design Philosophy

These skills assume Claude's intelligence — they focus on:

- **Non-technical founder perspective** and common mistakes
- **Tool selection criteria** (when to use Lovable vs Claude Code vs Replit)
- **Actionable checklists** and "Tell AI:" copy-paste prompts
- **What's out of scope** (preventing premature optimization)
- Concise, actionable content that avoids explaining concepts Claude already knows
